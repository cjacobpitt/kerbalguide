            <h2>Welcome to <i>Kerbal Space Program</i>!</h2>
            <p>This guide will help you learn how to build a rocket, manage your space agency, and get into orbit.</p>
            <br><br>
            <h1>Section 1: Introductions</h1>
            <p id="blurb">Kerbal Space Program is a game built on the idea of "failing upward". Your rockets will explode, your astronauts will be stranded, and missions will fail. But each failure is a learning experience. This guide is here to assist you in understanding how this game works, how to fail correctly, and how to learn from everything that you do. This section will introduce you to the basic mechanics of the game and get you on the path to the stars.</p>
            <br>

            <h2>The Ins and Outs of Rocket Science</h2>
            <p id="blurb"></p>
            <br>
            <h3>Types of Rocket Parts</h3>
            <ol>
            
                <li><strong>Command Modules:</strong> These are the brain of the rocket. Whether or not it is a smart brain is really up to you. Command modules can be broadly put into two sub-categories: Manned and unmanned. Manned command modules need a certain number of astronauts inside them to operate. Without an astronaut in the command module, the player cannot control the rocket at all. Unmanned modules do not contain astronauts, and instead use electricity to control the rocket. No electricity, no control. Each of these options has pros and cons, but in the beginning you will only have access to manned modules.</li>
                
                <li><strong>Fuel Tanks:</strong> Fuel is arguably the most important resource you have. Without fuel you cannot go anywhere, and in some cases you cannot make navigational adjustments. There are four types of fuel that you can use, but only three of them are accessible in this menu:<ol type="A">
                   <li><strong>Solid Fuel:</strong> Solid fuel is only found in solid fuel boosters and is not found in this menu. What makes it different is that once you have activated a solid fuel booster, you cannot turn it off. The fuel burns at 100% burn until there is no more to burn.</li>
                    <li><strong>Liquid Fuel:</strong> Liquid fuel is the most common type of fuel you will be working with. Liquid fuel can be throttled as necessary so it is used for mid-to-late stages of your flight for more fine points of navigation. Liquid fuel comes in two parts: liquid fuel and oxidizer. These two resources burn at a proportional rate, and each fuel tank has the correct ratios of fuel to oxidizer, so it is rarely a consideration, but if for some reason your rocket stops moving despite having some fuel left it may have to do with a lack of oxidizer.</li>
                    <li><strong>Monopropellant:</strong> Monopropellant is liquid fuel without oxidizer and is used as fuel for Reaction Control System (RCS) thrusters.</li>
                    <li><strong>Xenon Gas:</strong> Xenon gas tanks are used to fuel ion engines.</li></ol></li>
                    <table>
                        <tr>
                        <th>Solid Fuel</th>
                        <th>Liquid Fuel</th>
                        <th>Monopropellant</th>
                        <th>Xenon Gas</th>
                        </tr>
                        <tr>
                            <td><img src="Images/solid-fuel.png" width="400px"/></td>
                            <td><img src="Images/liquid-fuel.png" width="200px"/></td>
                            <td><img src="Images/Mono-fuel.png" width="200px;"/></td>
                            <td><img src="Images/Xenon-fuel.png" width="200px"/></td>
                        </tr>
                    </table>
                <li><strong>Engines:</strong> As easy as it can be to consider engines as the workhorse of rockets with little variation (we want the biggest engines to make the rocket go fast, right?), there are many nuances to engines, with many different types of engines, all with differing capabilities. Each engine utilizes one of the fuel types as discussed above, and each of these engine types has pros and cons as well and some general archetypes of use.<ol type="A">
                    <li><strong>Solid Fuel Booster:</strong> Due to the high power of a solid fuel booster and the fact that it cannot be turned off until no fuel is left, solid fuel boosters are most often used to begin a flight. They create incredible amounts of lift and acceleration and create a solid (haha) foundation for the remainder of the flight. Often a solid fuel booster is paired with a decoupler to allow for it to be easily jettisoned once it has been used up.</li>
                    <li><strong>Liquid Fuel Booster:</strong> As noted in the section on liquid fuel tanks, the key component of liquid fuel is that it can be throttled. Liquid fuel engines allow for much more precision at the cost of power. A liquid engine set to max will not give the same level of acceleration as a solid fuel engine, but once a high velocity has been established, the liquid fuel engine will easily be able to maintain that velocity.</li>
                    <li><strong>RCS Thruster:</strong> Reaction Control System thrusters are small, radial-mounted thrusters designed to use a small boost to help turn the ship. These thrusters use monopropellant to generate small thrusts that assist you in turning or rotating your ship.</li>
                    <li><strong>Ion Engines:</strong> Ion engines are small and run on either xenon gas or electricity. Because they can run on electricity many ion engines are used in space probes or in rockets that will have to be in space for a long time where being able to refuel with solar power allows for near endless usage. Ion engines are weak, though, especially in atmospheric conditions and it is almost impossible to launch a rocket with only an ion engine.</li></ol></li>
                <li><strong>Command and Control:</strong> Command and control is all about the parts that help you steer your rocket. Stability Augmentation System (SAS) parts are found here along with inline reaction wheels. Inline reaction wheels provide more torque when turning, which results in a more responsive ship..</li>
                <li><strong>Structural:</strong> Structural contains everything that helps keep the spaceship together (or in some cases, precisely take it apart). Structural contains decouplers, which use small explosions to disconnect and push parts off and away from the spaceship. This is especially useful for parts of the ship that are no longer of use, such as empty fuel tanks or empty solid state boosters. Structural also contains adapters, couplers, and struts, all of which help keep a rocket stable and together. Structure also contains the stability enhancer, which helps keep the rocket upright before launch.</li>
                <li><strong>Aerodynamics:</strong> Aerodynamics contains all of the parts needed to help give your ship more aerodynamic capabilities. This includes fins, wings, nose cones, and much more.</li>
                <li><strong>Utility:</strong> Utility is a massive category, and mostly contains advanced spaceship parts. The more basic utility features include landing gears, parachutes, ladders, batteries and electric generators, lights, wheels, and radiators. There are more features, but these are for advanced missions that this guide will not be covering.</li>
                <li><strong>Science:</strong> Science contains all of the instruments used to conduct science experiments and get science points. These can range from things like mystery goo to thermometers to barometers. Importantly, science also contains communication systems, which help transmit data back to Kerbin.</li>

            <h1>Section 2: Your First Launch</h1>
            <h2>2.1: Building Your First Rocket</h2>
            <p id="blurb">Now that we know our way around the interface, we can start to build our first rocket. This rocket will be basic, but it will follow the same building paradigms that will show up in all subsequent rockets. </p>
            <br>
            <ol>
                <li>We begin with the command module. All we have available to us is the <a href="#" class="module">Mk1 Command Pod</a> at the start so we will place that in our canvas.</li>
                <li>There are two options available for how to attach the <a href="#" class="module">RT-5 "Flea" Solid Fuel Booster</a>.<ol>
                    <li><strong>Explosive Decoupling</strong>: This means just stacking the boosters on top of one another. When the bottom-most booster is depleted, the next one will fire off and after a few seconds, the heat will explode the depleted booster and the rocket will continue upwards.</li>
                    <li><strong>Girder-Attached Boosters</strong>: This is based around placing one booster and then placing three <a href="#" class="module">Modular Girder Segment</a>s around that middle booster, then finally placing a booster on each girder segment. This will be achieved using the symmetry option.</li></ol></li>
                <li>Place an <a href="#" class="module">Mk16 Parachute</a> on the top of the command module.
                <li>Place some <a href="#" class="module">Basic Fin</a>s on either the middle booster or on the three girder-attached boosters.</li>
                <li>If you would like, place a <a href="#" class="module">Mystery Goo Containment Unit</a> on the command module. This unit helps you get more science points, which gives you more parts at a faster rate.</li>
